# Conclusion

	It can be concluded that in most cases there is no correlation to be found between both emotion and sentiment in regards to the time of day it was tweeted, the population density of the country it was tweeted from, and the age of the demographic tweeting. However, there is a slight correlation between sad tweets originating from a country with a smaller land area. It was predicted that the time of day would have an effect on the emotion of the tweets posted but, as previously stated, this was not the case. It would be interesting to use these trained models on transcripts of customer calls for a given business. This would be an applicable real-world scenario in which these emotion predicting models could thrive.
