##2 Pre-Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis
#2.1 Dataset Collection
The dataset used for the creation and training of the machine learning models was sourced from Kaggle.com, a platform containing open-sourced datasets for machine learning applications. The particular one used is here and contains the dataset of interest containing approximately 27,500 tweets of training data and 3,500 tweets of testing data. Out of the approximately 31,000 rows, 1000 were randomly chosen and used as human-sampled ground-truth testing and training sets. This process required a manual human review of 1000 tweets to determine the perceived emotion of each tweet. The emotions were split into seven categories labeled: “happiness”, “sadness”, “anger”, “disgust”, “surprise”, “fear”, and “df”. The label “df” corresponds to “default” and was applied to tweets that were either neutral or non-deterministic of emotion by the means of human review. The columns of most interest for the training and testing from the dataset to the model are the text column, containing the text of the tweet, and the emotion column containing the human-reviewed emotion of the tweet. Worth noting, this process was performed after data pre-processing discussed below.

#2.2 Data Pre-Processing
To prepare the datasets for model training, testing, and analysis there were a few steps of preprocessing the text of the tweet to be machine-readable for the packages used. Firstly, the dataset contained null values that were removed using the .dropna() function on the data frame. Following this, all of the text was converted to object-type string to ensure that each row-column of text was identifiable as a string and not a text object. The text was then converted to lowercase and all instances of backquotes (`) were replaced with apostrophes (‘) as the text used backquotes instead of apostrophes causing issues with stopword extraction. Once converted, stopword extraction using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) was used to get a list of stopwords to remove from each string object. The reason for removing stopwords (including “the”, “in”, “your” etc.) from string data is to filter out impractical and abundant words in NLP (Geeksforgeeks. (2017, May 22)). These words do not provide any useful characteristics to the data for emotion analysis so removing them increases the predictability of the model, less data to evaluate, and gives more focus to important words (such as “love” or “hate”) (Khanna, C. (2021, February 10)). After stopword removal, all special characters including links and user handles were removed using regex as these provide no valuable data to use in emotion analysis. Following this, all punctuation used in the text is then removed (note: removal of punctuation previously would cause the removal of stopwords using punctuation to have no effect). Finally, all numerical values from 0-9 were removed from the text to ensure only words were used to train the model. 

After the pre-processing of the dataset, the human-reviewed samples were generated and evaluated to determine emotion for the next steps in the investigation procedure, as well as, cleaning the data for model evaluation of the whole dataset for objective analysis.  

#2.3 Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualisations
The only useful data that can be used for extrapolating emotion analysis from the tweets are the text of the tweet itself and the human-reviewed associated emotion determined within the sampling sets. In order to identify any outliers within the set, boxplots were assembled. From there we could see that Russia was an outlier within the land area constraint. In order to compensate for outliers, we only included countries with a land size greater than 1000 km^2 and smaller than 9000 km^2. This gave us a more balanced graph that could be used to identify trends in the data. When visualizing the correlation between time of day and age of users, pie charts were made. In order for the data to be accurately portrayed in a readable way we grouped the four smallest emotion counts together to form an “other” category. This proves its necessity when building out the boxplots; none of the four emotions on their own contained enough data points to create a plot.
