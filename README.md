This is a project my friend and I did for our machine learning course.


Project Title
==============================
Text-Based Emotional Classification in Tweets 


Project Abstract
==============================
## Introduction: ##

For this final project, we are looking on investigating natural language processing (NLP) and its relationship to emotion analysis in text. The three datasets that we will be exploring consist of approximately 27,500 tweets of training data and 3,500 tweets of testing data consisting of the following columns:

0. textID
1. text (in tweet)
2. selected_text (in tweet)
3. sentiment (negative, positive, neutral)
4. time of tweet (morning, noon, night)
5. country
6. population
7. land area
8. population density


## Objectives: ##

The objective of this project is to understand the relationship between tweets and the text within them to determine the answers to the questions based on the statistics derived from the datasets:

* relationship between sentiment/emotion of tweets based on the time of day.
* relationship between sentiment/emotion of tweets based user age.
* relationship between sentiment/emotion of tweets based on geographical land size.
* relationship between sentiment/emotion of tweets based on population density.


## Methodology: ##

The models that we plan to train using this dataset consist of a linear regression model, logistic regression model, and a support vector machine (SVM) model. If the following supervised models do not provide the results we expect during testing and analysis, we will consider using either a recurrent neural network or a random forest to classify our data during emotional analysis instead. The goal of these supervised models is to determine the emotional connotation of text within tweets to provide insight on new and pre-existing data for the questions mentioned in the objective above.
